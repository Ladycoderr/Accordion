    question: 'What is data-structure?',
    answer:'Data structure is a way of defining, storing & retriving of data in a structural & systemetic way. A data structure may contain different type of data items.'
},
{
    id:2,
    question: 'What are various data-structures available?',
    answer:'Data structure availability may vary by programming languages. Commonly available data structures are list, arrays, stack, queues, graph, tree etc..'

},
{
    id:3,
    question: 'What is algorithm?',
    answer:'Algorithm is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output',
},
{
    id:4,
    question: 'Why we need to do algorithm analysis??',
    answer:'A problem can be solved in more than one ways. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm',

},
{
    id:5,
    question: 'What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?',
    answer:'Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm, refers to defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.'

},
{
    id:6,
    question: 'What are the criteria of algorithm analysis?',
    answer:'An algorithm are generally analyzed on two factors âˆ’ time and space. That is, how much execution time and how much extra space required by the algorithm.'
